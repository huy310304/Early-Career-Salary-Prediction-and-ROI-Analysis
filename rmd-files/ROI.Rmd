## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Importing csv file
```{r }
historical_tuition <- read_csv("historical_tuition.csv")
diversity_school <- read_csv("diversity_school.csv")
salary_potential <- read_csv("salary_potential.csv")
tuition_cost <- read_csv("tuition_cost.csv")
tuition_income <- read_csv("tuition_income.csv")

# check all the dataset to be imported
head(tuition_income)

```

```{r}


```

## ROI return (early + mid career) from each school

## Data cleaning
```{r}
# Drop 'rank' column from salary_potential
salary_potential <- salary_potential %>% select(-rank)

# Drop 'state_code', 'room_and_board', 'in_state_tuition', and 'out_of_state_tuition' columns from tuition_cost
tuition_cost <- tuition_cost %>% select(-state_code, -room_and_board, -in_state_tuition, -out_of_state_tuition)

# Prepare enrollment data by dropping 'category' and 'enrollment' columns, then removing duplicates and resetting the index
enrollment <- diversity_school %>% select(-category, -enrollment) %>% distinct()

# Merge salary_potential and tuition_cost data on 'name' column
merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost <- merge(salary_potential, tuition_cost, by = "name")

# Drop 'state_name' column from the merged data
merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost <- merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost %>% select(-state_name)

# Merge the result with enrollment data on 'name' column
merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost <- merge(merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost, enrollment, by = "name")

head(merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost)

# Create a new 'state' column by copying 'state_x', then drop 'state_x', 'state_y', and 'index' columns
merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost <- merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost %>%
  mutate(state = state.x) %>%
  select(-state.x, -state.y)

# Calculate max between 'in_state_total' and 'out_of_state_total' and store it in a new column 'tuition_total'
merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost <- merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost %>%
  mutate(tuition_total = pmax(in_state_total, out_of_state_total, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(-in_state_total, -out_of_state_total)

# Select relevant columns and rename them
merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost <- merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost %>%
  select(name, state, type, degree_length, tuition_total, early_career_pay,
         mid_career_pay, make_world_better_percent, stem_percent, total_enrollment)

data = merged_salary_potential_tuition_cost

  main = "Comparison of Tuition and Career Pay",
  xlab = "Categories",
  ylab = "Amount (USD)",
  outline = FALSE # Remove outliers for a cleaner look
)
```

## Computing ROI : net income/net investment *100
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(ROI = ((mid_career_pay+ early_career_pay)/2 - tuition_total) / tuition_total * 100)

# Remove "Western Governors University" from the dataset
data <- data %>%
  filter(name != "Western Governors University")

```

## ploting result
```{r}
