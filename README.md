- **ROI Calculation:** Assess the financial value of colleges using net income relative to tuition costs.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize Random Forest regression to predict early career salaries and identify key influencing factors.
- **Visualizations:** Provide clear, actionable graphs to illustrate trends and results.
